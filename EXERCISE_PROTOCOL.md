# PorchFitness Exercise Protocol

## Standardized Reps & Sets

### STRETCHES (Hold Exercises)
**Protocol:** 3 reps × 20 seconds each = 1 minute total per stretch

1. **Hamstring Stretch** - 3 reps × 20 sec each leg
2. **Figure 4 Stretch** - 3 reps × 20 sec each leg  
3. **Spinal Twist** - 3 reps × 20 sec each side
4. **Side Bends** - 3 reps × 20 sec each side
5. **Neck Stretches** - 3 reps × 20 sec each direction
6. **Warrior I** - 3 reps × 20 sec each side

**Coaching:** Count down from 20 slowly (2-3 sec between numbers), encourage breathing, then repeat 2 more times.

### STRENGTH & MOBILITY EXERCISES  
**Protocol:** 2 sets × 10 reps (30-second rest between sets)

7. **Sit to Stands** - 2 sets × 10 reps

9. **Shoulder Circles** - 2 sets × 10 reps (forward, then backward)  
10. **Cat/Camel (Cat-Cow)** - 2 sets × 10 reps
11. **Arm Raises** - 2 sets × 10 reps

## Samantha's Role (No Metronome Needed!)

✅ **Samantha CAN keep time** - She's a conversational AI who counts out loud
- For 20-second holds: She counts down "Twenty... Nineteen... Eighteen..."
- For 10 reps: She counts "One... Two... Three..." 
- She maintains proper 2-3 second pacing for senior safety

❌ **No separate metronome/database needed** - Voice coach handles all timing

## Why This Protocol Works

- **Consistency:** Every user gets the same safe, effective workout structure
- **Simplicity:** Easy for Samantha to coach and users to remember
- **Safety:** Slow pacing (2-3 sec between counts) prevents rushed movements
- **Effectiveness:** Research-backed rep ranges for senior fitness
- **Time-efficient:** ~2-3 minutes per exercise when fully coached

## Example Full Session

1. User clicks "Hamstring Stretch"
2. Samantha: "Let's do hamstring stretches. Stop if you feel pain. Sit up tall, extend your right leg..."
3. Samantha counts: "Twenty... breathe... Nineteen... Eighteen..." (20 seconds)
4. Samantha: "And release. That's one rep. Let's do two more on this leg."
5. Repeat 2 more times
6. Switch to left leg, repeat 3 times
7. Total time: ~2 minutes for full hamstring stretch protocol
